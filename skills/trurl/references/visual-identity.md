> Hermes adapter: use this plugin's native `trurl_*` tools and its storage bridge. SQLite in the active Hermes profile remains authoritative; the bridge creates and removes file snapshots internally. Any `model/` paths below describe internal evidence formats, not files to create or edit. The native calls below replace standalone commands; pass arguments to the registered tools rather than invoking a shell. Retain one plan and its returned seeds. Use Hermes's verified native scheduler for delivery.

# Trurl visual identity

Use this reference when creating a designed selection card, visual brief, or other visual export. It is the project's visual identity, not evidence about a person's taste. Follow their requested format and keep ordinary chat selections concise.

## Wordmark and voice

Write **Trurl**, with a capital T. The brand line is **A personal selection.**

Use the bundled vector artwork rather than retyping or generating the logo:

- [Black wordmark](../assets/trurl-wordmark.svg), for white backgrounds.
- [White wordmark](../assets/trurl-wordmark-inverse.svg), for black backgrounds.

These are custom vector reconstructions of the approved original wordmark study, not an identified commercial typeface. Preserve their proportions and spacing. Keep clear space of at least one letter-stem width around the wordmark; never crop the letters. If images are unavailable, write the name as ordinary text rather than approximating the logo with decorative characters.

Use plain, specific language and keep the focus on the works. Use the brand line once per brief if it fits.

## Palette

| Role | Color | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Background | `#FFFFFF` | Primary surface |
| Ink | `#090909` | Wordmark, titles, body text |
| Secondary text | `#6B6B6B` | Supporting metadata |
| Rule | `#E6E6E6` | Quiet dividers |
| Blue | `#2355C6` | Optional small marker or link |
| Red | `#C53A32` | Alternative small marker |

White and black carry the identity. Choose at most one accent per composition, used sparingly. On a dark surface, use the white wordmark and white text; the accent colors above are intended for white surfaces. Keep essential text legible and pair any color-coded meaning with a text label.

The **Taste Atlas** uses a white surface, the black wordmark and neutral sans serif type throughout. It can use both accents sparingly: blue for tentative interests, focus and selection; red for exploratory possibilities. Stated interests use solid black circles, tentative interests use open blue circles, and possibilities use open red diamonds, with a text key. Keep map guides and dividers neutral. Use a darker neutral for input and button borders so controls remain visible on white.

The Atlas Connections view focuses on one selected work and its paths from interests. Use solid lines for sourced content relationships and dashed lines for recorded recommendation reasons or tentative taste hypotheses, with explicit text labels. Distinguish works, topics and creators without relying on colour alone. Keep source details accessible beside the diagram and provide readable route descriptions for small screens and keyboard use. Layout and proximity must not imply preference strength.

## Composition

Aim for timeless elegance through whitespace, alignment, and proportion. Use a neutral sans serif for supporting text, with a clear title/body hierarchy and comfortable reading size. The host's available system sans serif is sufficient; the logo does not require a font installation.

A selection card can contain the small Trurl wordmark, a heading such as “Your selection,” a quiet rule, and the selected work's medium, title, creator, and direct link. Include selection reasons only on explicit request. Use the actual researched selection and verified metadata. A weekly date or issue number is useful only when known.

Keep cards and briefs focused on the works. Leave internal weighting charts and algorithm details out of the visual by default. Use simple flat surfaces rather than paper textures, gradients, heavy borders, ornamental icons, or decorative panels.

## Portability and privacy

The SVG assets are self-contained paths with transparent backgrounds. Copy or embed them using paths resolved relative to the skill directory. When a renderer requires a bitmap, render these assets locally; do not fetch a substitute logo.

A shareable card contains only the selected content and the context the person chooses to share. Branding a selection does not authorize publishing the person's profile, history, or private rationale.
